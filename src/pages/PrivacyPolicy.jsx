                    We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out

                    either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your

                    storage, and disclosure of personal information (including SPDI). Our security procedures may
                    warrant that we occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to
                    you.
                    We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets

                    security of Your information as per the international standards on "Information Technology Security
                    Techniques Information Security Management System-Requirements".
                    We restrict access to personal information to Our employees and agents who need to know that
                    information to process it for Us and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality
                    obligations and may be disciplined or whose relationship with Us may terminate if they fail to meet
                    these obligations.

                    <h3>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>


                    Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information,
                    which may be express and/or implied consent, depending on the applicable law, you have the right to
                    withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by
                    using the contact details provided in this policy in the Contact Us section.


                    However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its
                    withdrawal, nor when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal
                    information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.


                    Opting out of marketing and promotional communications: You can unsubscribe from our marketing and

                    However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that
                    are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for
                    other non-marketing purposes.

                    <h3>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>


                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
                    ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
                    your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology
                    standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not
                    currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
                    choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
                    the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
